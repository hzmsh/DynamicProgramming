# Dynamic Programming Repository: Classic Problems Solved üöÄ

Welcome to my dynamic programming repository where I explore and explain solutions to classic problems using both recursion and dynamic programming techniques. This repository serves as a practical reference for coding enthusiasts interested in understanding and applying dynamic programming strategies to solve problems efficiently.

## About the Repository

This repository includes Python scripts that demonstrate dynamic programming and recursion solutions to well-known problems, currently featuring:
- Fibonacci Sequence (Leetcode 509)
   - [Recursion vs. Dynamic Programming: Climbing Stairs](https://medium.com/geekculture/recursion-vs-dynamic-programming-climbing-stairs-48032b31db98)
- Climbing Stairs (Leetcode 70)
   - [Recursion vs. Dynamic Programming: Climbing Stairs](https://medium.com/geekculture/recursion-vs-dynamic-programming-climbing-stairs-48032b31db98)

Each solution is discussed with respect to both its recursive and dynamic programming implementations, including analysis of time and space complexities.

## Installation üíΩ

To clone and run these scripts locally, use the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-programming-problems.git
cd dynamic-programming-problems
```

### Fibonacci Sequence üß¨

**Description**: The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where a number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

**Example Usage**:

```bash
python fibonacci.py 10
```

**Detailed Analysis**: Includes performance comparison of recursive vs dynamic programming approaches with visual aids.

### Climbing Stairs üßó‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

**Description**: Determine the number of ways to climb `n` steps when you can climb either one or two steps at a time.

**Example Usage**:

```bash
python climbing_stairs.py 5
```

**Detailed Analysis**: Focuses on optimizing the recursive solution using dynamic programming techniques to reduce time complexity from exponential to polynomial.

## Usage üöÄ

To run any script, navigate to the specific problem directory and run the Python script with an appropriate argument. For example:

```bash
python fibonacci.py 10
```

Replace `10` with any number to compute its Fibonacci value using dynamic programming.
